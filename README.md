# myElemes: Learning Management System (LMS) Project

Check the message above this section for urgent read, thanks for stopping by :) Welcome to the simple Learning Management System (LMS) project repository. This system is designed as part of my application for a tech fellowship, demonstrating foundational skills in web development using Express, Node.js, React, and PostgreSQL.

## Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive LMS that facilitates educational processes by providing essential functionalities for students, teachers, and administrators. The system is built with a focus on scalability, security, and user-friendly interfaces.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## Features
- Role-based access control (for teachers and students)
- User registration and login/logout
- Profile viewing
- Grades submission (for teachers) and tracking (for student)

## Current Progress

Roles:
